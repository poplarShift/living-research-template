# This is a human-maintainable environment yaml file with minimal indications
# of versions. it is used for setting up the environment by humans
# and docker2repo.
# It will use the newest available and compatible software versions,
# which may not be desirable for 100% replication.
# Reproducibility may be easier when running the environment as a Docker image
